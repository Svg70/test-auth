# Test task Auth + Simple blog

## Technical scope: 

### Frontend:
    React + Apollo + Redux Toolkit

### Backend:
    Express + GraphQL + Apollo + Sequelize

## Project run 
1. Server part settings:
    ### `cd server`
    ### `npm install`
    ### `npm run start`
2. Client part settings:
    ### `cd client`
    ### `npm install`
    ### `npm run start`

This project was a real challenge for me. Because I don't have good experience with Sequelize and graphQL technologies before. So the backend part were pretty complecated for me, and if I have more time, I fix the issues with Sequelize types. All in all I think that this was really good experience - which shows how flexible could be backend based on GraphQL
